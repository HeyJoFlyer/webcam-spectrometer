# Open Source Webcam Spectrometer Software

This repo aims to provide a simple software to use your own diy webcam ir/vis spectrometer. You can build your own spectrometer for only around **15 â‚¬** / $. This project was inspired by Theremino, which is really old, Windows only and deprecated.

This project is currently in development and not ready to install

## Building your own Spectrometer

To build your own ir/vis Spectrometer you will need the following parts:

- webcam
- diffraction grating / dvd
- enclosure
- Razor blade / tape / dark paper to create a very thin slit

The main idea of this project is to use a refraction grating to split the different wavelengths of the light, which will then be captured by the webcam. The relative intensities will be evaluated and plotted by this software.
