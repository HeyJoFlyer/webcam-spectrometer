# 3D Printed Enclosure

You can easily print this enclosure to fit your own spectrometer. You probably going to need to disassemble your webcam anyways to fit your diffraction grating.

## The following aspects will limit your resolution:

1. The width of the slit: The wider it is the lower your resolution will be; but it will allow more light to enter

1. The line space of your diffraction grating: The closer the lines are spaced the more the different wavelengths will spread.

1. The distance between the camera and the diffraction grating: The greater the distance, the more the light can spread across the sensor.

1. The resolution of your webcam


## Getting a refraction grating

As I didn't have a refraction grating from a DVD. First of all you need to crack the dvd. There will be multiple layers. I discarded the reflective layer and just used the very thin data layer which acts as the refraction grating.

Alternatively you can just buy a refraction grating as this will probably work better as it isn't curved and generally more transparent.

## Creating a thin slit

You need to create a very thin slit at the hole to allow a thin slit of light to reach the diffraction grating. You can do this with a cut in half safety razor blade (preferred) or dark tape or dark paper.
